# JOVAC-x-CB-2025
I'm actively participating in the Jovac Full Stack Web Development program provided by my college, where Iâ€™m learning to build modern, responsive web applications from the ground up. The course emphasizes practical, real-world skills using a powerful tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. This repository serves as a portfolio of my progress, featuring a collection of projects and assignments that reflect my evolving capabilities in full stack development.
